  Nowadays, complex artificial intelligence algorithms are capable of classifying images and detecting unique pattern among the group of the pictures as human eye does. With the inspiration from these outstanding algorithms, I decided to solve the problem of diagnosis of several skin diseases with the help of artificial intelligence. This github repository includes the all jupyter notebooks which are used for analysis of image data and training machine learning model to detect skin disorders.
