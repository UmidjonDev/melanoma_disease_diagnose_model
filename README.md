###  Author: Umidjon Sattorov, Machine Learning Engineer, successful graduate of the SkillBox platform, and student at the Mohirdev platform

**Overview**

This project involves the development of a mobile application designed to detect skin disorders using machine learning models. Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and powerful libraries such as Fastai and TensorFlow, the application can accurately identify various skin conditions. The machine learning model was seamlessly integrated with an Android application to provide a user-friendly interface for real-time skin disorder detection.

**Features**

High Accuracy: Utilizes a robust CNN model for accurate skin disorder detection.
Real-time Analysis: Provides instant results through the mobile application.
User-Friendly Interface: Designed with Kotlin in Android Studio for an intuitive user experience.
Scalable Solution: Model deployed on a cloud server to handle multiple requests efficiently.

**Technologies Used**

Python: Core programming language for developing the machine learning model.
Fastai & TensorFlow: Libraries used for creating and training the CNN model.
Flask: Python framework for creating the server and API endpoints.
Android Studio & Kotlin: Tools and language used for developing the Android mobile application.
Cloud Services: Hosting the machine learning model to ensure accessibility and scalability.

**Repository Structure**

Android_App: Contains the source code for the Android application developed in Kotlin.

ML: Includes the server code and Jupyter notebooks used for creating and testing the machine learning model. Note: Pickle models and datasets are not included in the repository but can be generated by running the provided Jupyter notebooks.

**Results**
